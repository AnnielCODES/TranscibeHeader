# TranscibeHeader
Make it easy when transcribing voice to text by not typing who said what
Simply have an empty line inbetween the text of the other person

Example without this program
{
ME: How was your experience working at .....
Ms. Smith: I beleive my time there was great but....
}

Example using this program
{
How was your experience working at....

I beleive my time there was great but...
}
The text file then runs through the program and adds the headers like
Me: & Ms.Smith and then an output is saved into a new file


**********************************************************************************
This only works when only two people are "speaking"
Just specify the names at the begining starting with the first person that speaks
Usually that person is the interviewer followed by the person being interviewed
